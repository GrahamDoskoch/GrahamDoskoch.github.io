							<p>
								I'm Graham, a third-year PhD student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University!
								My work is centered on pulsars, fast-spinning neutron stars emitting beams of radio waves, and gravitational wave
								detection via pulsar timing arrays. I work with Prof. Maura McLaughlin at the <a href="https://gwac.wvu.edu/">
								Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology</a>.
								<br><br>
								I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2020 with a B.A. in astrophysics and mathematics. While I was there,
								I worked with <a href="https://astro.swarthmore.edu/~cohen/students.html">David Cohen</a> to use x-ray
								spectra from Chandra to study the winds of massive O and B stars. Pulsars have always been what I'm
								most passionate about, though, which is why I ended up in WVU.
								<br><br>
								I also enjoy science communication, and outreach is a big part of my academic life. Since 2021, I've written for
								<a href="https://astrobites.org/">Astrobites</a>, writing accessible summaries of papers on arXiv, I also mentor
								high school students interested in pulsars. When I'm not coding or writing, you can find me reading or
								hiking through the beautiful hills of West Virginia.

								I'm a pulsar person. Pulsars are fast-spinning neutron stars with powerful magnetic fields that give rise to
								beams of light - often radio waves - emanating from their magnetic poles. Since a pulsar's magnetic and
								rotational axes are usually misaligned, this means that these beams sweep across the sky, like a cosmic
								lighthouse. From our Earth-bound point of view, they appear to be brief, periodic pulses, often with
								beautiful, complex structure. Besides being interest objects in their own right, they have one unusual
								application: gravitational wave detection.
								<br><br>
								When someone talks about gravitational waves, the first thing that comes to mind might be ground-based
								interferometers like LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA, which brought gravitational waves into the public eye with their
								first direct detections in 2014. However, these instruments can only study a small portion of the gravitational
								wave spectrum. As an analogy with light, imagine if we could only see the universe through optical telescopes -- no
								x-ray telescopes like Chandra or infrared observatories like Spitzer. We'd miss out on so much!
								<br><br>
								Interferometers like LIGO operate very roughly in the 10 hertz to 10 kilohertz frequency band of the
								gravitational wave spectrum, limiting what sorts of sources they can observe to things like merging
								stellar-mass or intermediate-mass binary black holes, or gravitational waves from supernovae. However, binary
								supermassive black holes also emit gravitational waves, with frequencies in the nanohertz range, forming a
								stochastic gravitational wave background. LIGO can't see this -- but pulsar timing arrays can.
								<br><br>
								Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are designed to detect these binary supermassive black holes and other low-frequency
								sources. We monitor numerous millisecond-period pulsars over years and decades with radio telescopes. Passing
								gravitational waves change when pulses arrive at Earth, and by looking for certain characteristic behaviors in
								these arrival times, we can search for this stochastic background and other interesting things, like individual
								binary supermassive black holes, or more exotic structures like cosmic strings.
								<br><br>
								I'm a member of the <a href="http://nanograv.org/">North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational
								Waves</a>, or NANOGrav, a PTA based in North America that primarily uses the Green Bank Telescope and the
								now-collapsed Arecibo Observatory, along with some data from CHIME and the Very Large Array. We've come very close
								to detecting the stochastic background and have already seen hints of it in our 12.5-year data set. However, we're
								not the only pulsar timing array out there; the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) and the Parkes Pulsar Timing
								Array (PPTA) are increasingly sensitive, and there are newer collaborations like the Indian Pulsar Timing Array
								(InPTA) and MeerKAT.
								<br><br>
								We can increase the sensitivity of a PTA by adding in new pulsars and new telescopes -- so it makes sense to combine
								the data from all of these PTAs into one large data set. The <a href="http://ipta4gw.org/">
								International Pulsar Timing Array</a> (IPTA) does just that, using data from the three major PTAs, some of it
								stretching back to the 1990s. I'm a part of the team working on the IPTA's third data set, or DR3, which may lead
								to a detection of the stochastic background.

							<p>
								Not all pulsars are so regular! Some undergo unusual phenomena like nulling and mode-changing, in which their
								emission can change or even turn off for a while. A subpopulation of pulsars give rise to emission so sporadic
								that they have their own name: rotating radio transients, or RRATs (pronounced "rats" or "r-rats" - your
								choice!). They're still not well-understood, although plenty of mechanisms have been proposed over the last
								decade to explain them, including radiation belts, asteroids and the fallback of supernova material. They also
								might simply be old pulsars whose emission mechanisms are failing.
								<br><br>
								Currently, I'm studying a group of RRATs discovered by the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~palfa/">PALFA</a>
								survey at the Arecibo Observatory. PALFA was a survey running from 2004 to 2020, searching at L-band using
								Arecibo's ALFA receiver. It's yielded numerous millisecond pulsars and RRATs, and the dozen or so RRATs I'm
								working on are some of the few that have yet to be analyzed.
								<br><br>
								I'm hoping to finish the project this semester (spring 2023). It's a challenging task -- as is always the case
								when studying RRATs -- because we know some of these sources from only a few pulses in a couple observations.
								Extracting useful information from all of them has necessitated the use of several different techniques, including
								a reasonably standard <a href="https://github.com/scottransom/presto">PRESTO</a>-based single pulse pipeline and
								a slightly more complicated technique called wavelet denoising. While this project (likely!) won't solve the
								mystery of what RRATs actually are, these objects are rare enough that any new data is useful data.

								Single-pulse analyses can be useful in other realms of pulsar science. Some pulsars, like the Crab Pulsar,
								often emit giant pulses, much more energetic than normal ones. While the Crab isn't a RRAT, analyzing giant
								pulses using single-pulse techniques can give us clues as to what's behind them, possibly allowing glimpses
								into pulsar emission mechanisms. I'm currently co-leading a project for the <a href="https://pulsars.nanograv.org"/>
								Pulsar Search Collaboratory</a> studying giant pulses from the Crab using the 20-meter telescope at the
								Green Bank Observatory.
