								I'm Graham, a second-year PhD student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University.
								<a href="https://grahamdoskoch.github.io/#research">My work</a> is centered on pulsars, fast-spinning neutron
								stars emitting beams of radio waves, and gravitational wave detection via pulsar timing arrays.
								<br><br>
								I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2020 with a degree in astrophysics and mathematics. While I was there,
								I worked with <a href="https://astro.swarthmore.edu/~cohen/students.html">David Cohen</a> to use x-ray
								spectra from Chandra to study the winds of massive O and B stars. Pulsars have always been what I'm most
								passionate about, which is why I ended up in WVU, working with Prof. Maura McLaughlin at the
								<a href="https://gwac.wvu.edu/">Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology</a>.
								<br><br>
								I also enjoy science communication, and <a href="https://grahamdoskoch.github.io/#outreach">outreach</a> is a
								part of my academic life. I write for <a href="https://astrobites.org/">Astrobites</a> and also mentor high
								school students interested in astronomy. When I'm not coding or writing, you can find me doing crosswords or
								hiking through the beautiful hills of West Virginia.

								On the whole, I'm a pulsar person. Pulsars are fast-spinning neutron stars with powerful magnetic fields
								that give rise to beams of light - often radio waves - emanating from their magnetic poles. Since a pulsar's
								magnetic and rotational axes are usually misaligned, this means that these beams sweep across the sky, like
								a cosmic lighthouse. From our Earth-bound point of view, they appear to be brief, periodic pulses, often with
								beautiful, complex structure.
								<br><br>								
								There are plenty of subfields in pulsar astronomy; my work mostly falls into a couple particular categories.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Pulsar timing arrays and gravitational wave detection</b><br>
								When someone talks about gravitational waves, the first thing that comes to mind might be ground-based
								interferometers like LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA, which brought gravitational waves into the public eye with their
								first direct detections in 2014. These instruments can only study a small portion of the gravitational wave
								spectrum. Imagine if we could only see the universe through optical telescopes. We'd miss out on so much.
								<br><br>
								Interferometers like LIGO operate very roughly in the 10 hertz to 10 kilohertz frequency band of the
								gravitational wave spectrum, limiting what sorts of sources they can observe to things like merging
								stellar-mass or intermediate-mass binary black holes, or gravitational waves from supernovae. However, binary
								supermassive black holes also emit gravitational waves, with frequencies in the nanohertz range, forming a
								stochastic gravitational wave background.
								<br><br>
								Pulsar timing arrays are designed to detect binary supermassive black holes and other low-frequency sources
								by observing numerous pulsars with spin periods of around a few milliseconds. Passing gravitational waves
								should change when pulses arrive at our telescopes, and so by looking for some characteristic behavior in
								our pulsars, we can try and detect this stochastic background and other interesting things.
								<br><br>
								I'm an associate member of the <a href="http://nanograv.org/">North American Nanohertz Observatory for
								Gravitational Waves</a>, or NANOGrav. We've come very close to detecting the stochastic background and have
								already seen hints of it. My PhD thesis will be on expanding our results to become part of the <a href=
								"http://ipta4gw.org/">International Pulsar Timing Array</a> (IPTA). The IPTA is a collection of pulsar
								timing arrays from around the world, aiming to create the most sensitive pulsar timing dataset ever. My role
								is to work on pipelines to make it easier to add new telescopes and datasets into the mix, allowing the IPTA
								to keep expanding and becoming more and more sensitive.

								<b>Rotating radio transients and single-pulse timing</b><br>
								Not all pulsars are so regular! Some undergo unusual phenomena light nulling and mode-changing, in which their
								emission can change or even turn off for a time. A subpopulation of pulsars give rise to emission so sporadic
								that they have their own name: rotating radio transients, or RRATs (pronounced "rats" or "r-rats" - your
								choice!). They're still not well-understood, although plenty of mechanisms have been proposed over the last
								decade to explain them, including radiation belts, asteroids and the fallback of supernova material. They also
								might simply be old pulsars whose emission mechanisms are failing.
								<br><br>
								Currently, I'm studying a group of RRATs discovered by the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~palfa/">PALFA</a>
								survey at the Arecibo Observatory. PALFA was a survey running from 2004 to 2020, searching at L-band using
								Arecibo's ALFA receiver. It's yielded numerous millisecond pulsars and RRATs, and the dozen or so RRATs I'm
								working on are some of the few that have yet to be analyzed.
								<br><br>
								Single-pulse analyses can be useful in other realms of pulsar science. Some pulsars, like the Crab Pulsar,
								often emit giant pulses, much more energetic than normal ones. While the Crab isn't a RRAT, analyzing giant
								pulses using single-pulse techniques can give us clues as to what's behind them, possibly allowing glimpses
								into pulsar emission mechanisms. I'm currently co-leading a project for the <a href="https://pulsars.nanograv.org"/>
								Pulsar Search Collaboratory</a> studying giant pulses from the Crab using the 20-meter telescope at the
								Green Bank Observatory.

								<b>Astrobites</b>
								<br>
								I write for <a href="https://astrobites.org/">Astrobites</a>, a group of graduate students
								covering the latest research in astronomy and supported by the American Astronomical Society. We aim to write
								about preprints on <a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a> at a level understandable by undergraduates. I like
								to write about the same topics I study - pulsars, gravitational wave detection, and radio astronomy in
								general. You can read my latest pieces <a href="https://astrobites.org/author/gdoskoch/">here</a>.

								<b>Pulsar Search Collaboratory</b>
								<br>
								I'm a mentor for the <a href="https://pulsars.nanograv.org/">Pulsar Search Collaboratory</a>, a collaboration
								between WVU and the Green Bank Observatory, conducting outreach and teaching students how to search for and
								study pulsars. High schoolers and undergraduates get the chance to learn about working being done at Green
								Bank, search through data for candidate pulsars, and perform their own observations and participate in
								research projects.
							</p>
							<p>	<b>Pulsar of the Day</b>
								<br>
								Astronomers have discovered over 3000 pulsars over the past half century, and each and every one of them is
								interesting in its own way. I run the <a href="https://twitter.com/PulsarOfTheDay">@PulsarOfTheDay</a> Twitter
								account, which picks a random pulsar each day and tells you about its properties.
