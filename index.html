								<b>Rotating radio transients</b><br>Currently, I'm studying a group of rotating radio transients (RRATs)
								discovered by the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~palfa/">PALFA</a> survey at the Arecibo Observatory. RRATs
								behave like erratic pulsars, and usually need to be studied through single-pulse analyses instead of typical
								methods of observing and timing pulsars. They're still not very well understood, and may provide clues as to
								the behavior of older pulsars whose emission mechanisms may be failing.

								<b>NANOGrav</b><br>I'm an associate member of the <a href="http://nanograv.org/">North American Nanohertz
								Observatory for Gravitational Waves</a>, or NANOGrav, a pulsar timing array designed to detect gravitational
								waves in the nanohertz regime. This opens up a new region of the gravitational wave universe, allowing us to
								study supermassive black hole binaries and the hypothesized stochastic gravitational wave background.
