							<p>
								I'm Graham, a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at West Virginia University!
								My work is centered on pulsars, fast-spinning neutron stars emitting beams of radio waves. I work with Prof.
								Maura McLaughlin at the <a href="https://gwac.wvu.edu/">Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology</a>, as
								well as for <a href="https://nanograv.org/">NANOGrav</a> and the <a href="https://ipta4gw.org/">IPTA</a>. In
								particular, I specialize in single pulse searches, studies of the interstellar medium, and noise modeling for
								pulsar timing arrays.
								<br><br>
								I also enjoy science communication, and outreach is a big part of my academic life. From 2021 to 2023, I wrote for
								<a href="https://astrobites.org/">Astrobites</a>, writing accessible summaries of papers on arXiv. I also mentor
								high school students interested in pulsars for the <a href="https://pulsars.nanograv.org/">Pulsar Science
								Collaboratory</a>. When I'm not coding or writing, you can find me reading, gardening, making jam, or hiking
								through the beautiful hills of West Virginia.

							<p>
								I'm a pulsar person. Pulsars are fast-spinning neutron stars with powerful magnetic fields that give rise to
								beams of light - often radio waves - emanating from their magnetic poles. Since a pulsar's magnetic and
								rotational axes are usually misaligned, this means that these beams sweep across the sky, like a cosmic
								lighthouse. From our Earth-bound point of view, they appear to be brief, periodic pulses, often with
								beautiful, complex structure. Besides being interest objects in their own right, they have one unusual
								application: gravitational wave detection.
								<br><br>
								When someone talks about gravitational waves, the first thing that comes to mind might be ground-based
								interferometers like LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA, which brought gravitational waves into the public eye with their
								first direct detections in 2014. However, these instruments can only study a small portion of the gravitational
								wave spectrum. As an analogy with light, imagine if we could only see the universe through optical telescopes -- no
								x-ray telescopes like Chandra or infrared observatories like Spitzer. We'd miss out on so much!
								<br><br>
								Interferometers like LIGO operate very roughly in the 10 hertz to 10 kilohertz frequency band of the
								gravitational wave spectrum, limiting what sorts of sources they can observe to things like merging
								stellar-mass or intermediate-mass binary black holes, or gravitational waves from supernovae. However, binary
								supermassive black holes also emit gravitational waves, with frequencies in the nanohertz range, forming a
								stochastic gravitational wave background. LIGO can't see this -- but pulsar timing arrays can.
								<br><br>
								Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are designed to detect these binary supermassive black holes and other low-frequency
								sources. We monitor numerous millisecond-period pulsars over years and decades with radio telescopes. Passing
								gravitational waves change when pulses arrive at Earth, and by looking for certain characteristic behaviors in
								these arrival times, we can search for this stochastic background and other interesting things, like individual
								binary supermassive black holes, or more exotic structures like cosmic strings.
								<br><br>
								I'm a member of the <a href="http://nanograv.org/">North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational
								Waves</a>, or NANOGrav, a PTA based in North America that primarily uses the Green Bank Telescope and the
								now-collapsed Arecibo Observatory, along with CHIME and the Very Large Array. NANOGrav has come quite close to a 
								detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background. However, it's not only pulsar timing array out there;
								sister collaborations in Europe, Australia, India, South Africa and China have released similar results.
								<br><br>
								We can increase the sensitivity of a PTA by adding in new pulsars and new telescopes -- so it makes sense to combine
								the data from all of these PTAs into one large data set. The <a href="http://ipta4gw.org/">
								International Pulsar Timing Array</a> (IPTA) does just that, using data from the three major PTAs, some of it
								stretching back to the 1990s. I'm a part of the team working on the IPTA's third data set, or DR3, which may lead
								to a detection of the stochastic background.

							<p>
								Not all pulsars are so regular! Some undergo unusual phenomena like nulling and mode-changing, in which their
								emission can change or even turn off for a while. A subpopulation of pulsars give rise to emission so sporadic
								that they have their own name: rotating radio transients, or RRATs (pronounced "rats" or "r-rats" -- your
								choice!). They're still not well-understood, although plenty of mechanisms have been proposed over the last
								decade to explain them, including radiation belts, asteroids and the fallback of supernova material. They also
								might simply be old pulsars whose emission mechanisms are failing.
								<br><br>
								Currently, I'm studying a group of RRATs discovered by the <a href="http://www.naic.edu/~palfa/">PALFA</a>
								survey at the Arecibo Observatory. PALFA was a survey running from 2004 to 2020, searching at L-band using
								Arecibo's ALFA receiver. It's yielded numerous millisecond pulsars and RRATs, and the dozen or so RRATs I'm
								working on are some of the few that have yet to be analyzed.
								<br><br>
								Studying RRATs is a challenging task because we know some of these sources from only a few pulses in a couple observations.
								Extracting useful information from all of them has necessitated the use of several different techniques, including
								a reasonably standard <a href="https://github.com/scottransom/presto">PRESTO</a>-based single pulse pipeline and
								Bayesian analyses. The results, though, are important: single pulse statistical analyses and, for a few of the sources,
								timing solutions -- important because very few RRATs have timing solutions.

								Single-pulse analyses can be useful in other realms of pulsar science. Some pulsars, like the Crab Pulsar,
								often emit giant pulses, much more energetic than normal ones. I'm currently co-leading an outreach project
								mentoring high school and college students from the <a href="https://pulsars.nanograv.org"/>Pulsar Science Collaboratory</a>
								studying giant pulses from the Crab using the 20-meter telescope at the	Green Bank Observatory. We monitor the
								Crab on an approximately daily basis, search the observations for giant pulses, and then perform statistical analyses
								on the resulting data set.
								<br><br>
								Our first observing run lasted about 15 months and yielded some interesting insights into the Crab's giant pulse
								behavior We found that it is modulated by scintillation in the interstellar medium, as was expected based on existing
								studies of the Crab's ordinary emission. We also found indications of a short, dramatic spike in giant pulse rate in
								late 2022, of unknown origin
								<br><br>
								Our observations are continuing, and passed the three-year threshold in the spring of 2025. Several other projects
								using the data are in the works, including one using the observations to time the Crab and another to produce an even
								larger giant pulse data set, spanning hundreds of hours of observing time.

							<p>
								While most of my work is on pulsars, I'm involved in some projects on fast radio bursts (FRBs). Discovered around the same
								time as RRATs, FRBs are short, extragalactic bursts with durations on the order of ~1 ms. Some FRBs are known to repeat, while
								others are one-time-only events. While these objects are relatively new, an explosion of discoveries has occurred over the last
								half decade, thanks in part to the <a href="https://www.chime-frb.ca/">CHIME/FRB</a> project, which has quite literally discovered
								over 1000 of these enigmatic bursts.
								<br><br>
								The mechanism or mechanisms behind FRBs have not been definitively identified, although different subclasses of FRBs indicate that
								they may have different origins. Repeating FRBs clearly cannot come from cataclysmic events like supernovae or gamma ray bursts.
								Recently, a model in which FRBs result from flaring magnetars has gained steam after the detection of a pair of FRB-like bursts
								from the magnetar SGR 1935+2154 -- located within the Milky Way.
								<br><br>
								My FRB work is largely through <a href="https://github.com/thepetabyteproject">the Petabyte Project</a> (TPP), an effort here at WVU to
								sift through over one petabyte of data from numerous radio surveys to search for pulsars, RRATs, FRBs, and anything else that
								shows up. The main points of TPP are to perform this enormous searchs using one unified methodology, and to create a database for
								cross-checking candidates between surveys -- in other words, if we find a possible pulsar or FRB in one survey, we have a way to
								see whether the object shows up in another, which would be a large step towards validating it.

							<p>	<b>History of astronomy</b>
								<br>
								I'm fascinated with the history of radio astronomy, from its humble beginnings with Karl Jansky and
